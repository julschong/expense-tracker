# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is inspired by btraversy's Expense Track mini project: https://vanillawebprojects.com/projects/expense-tracker/

This implementation uses local storage to save the data in JSON format, then retrieve it on reload.
